# Literature Review Strategy: The Novevbev Problem

## 1. Search Matrix
Create a spreadsheet with these columns:
- Paper Title
- Authors
- Year
- Key Findings
- Relevance Score (1-5)
- Gap Identification
- Citations Count

## 2. Systematic Search Approach

### Phase 1: Core Topic Search
Search for direct overlaps:
```
("handwriting recognition" OR "OCR") AND
("human perception" OR "cognitive bias") AND
("pattern recognition" OR "character recognition")
```

### Phase 2: Related Phenomena
Search for similar documented issues:
```
("cursive recognition" OR "handwriting OCR") AND
("error patterns" OR "misrecognition") AND
("context awareness" OR "semantic understanding")
```

### Phase 3: Solution Space
Search for similar proposed solutions:
```
("LLM" OR "language model") AND
("OCR correction" OR "handwriting recognition") AND
("context integration" OR "hybrid system")
```

## 7. Timeline Approach

Week 1:
- Broad search using Phase 1 terms
- Initial categorization
- Identify key papers

Week 2:
- Deep dive into related phenomena
- Phase 2 search terms
- Update categorization

Week 3:
- Solution space exploration
- Phase 3 search terms
- Gap analysis

Week 4:
- Synthesis of findings
- Gap validation
- Research proposal refinement

## 8. Red Flags That Might Invalidate Your Research

Look for papers that:
1. Already identify the cursive 'm' misrecognition pattern
2. Propose LLM-based context correction for OCR
3. Discuss human-AI perception differences in handwriting
4. Present solutions for context-aware OCR

## 9. Supporting Evidence to Strengthen Your Case

Document:
1. Current OCR limitation statistics
2. Human reading accuracy studies
3. Real-world impact of misrecognition
4. Cost implications of errors
5. Scale of digitization needs
